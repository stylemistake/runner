Simple, lightweight task runner for Bash.

If you find any bugs, let me know by creating an [issue][issues].


## 1. Pre-requisites

Runner depends on:

* bash `>=4.0`
* coreutils `>=8.0`

These are very likely to be already installed on your Linux machine.

**Note for Mac OS X users:**

Use [Homebrew] to install the dependencies:

```bash
brew install bash coreutils
```


## 2. Installation

There are many different ways to use `runner` in your project.

Using `npm`:

```bash
## To install to your project folder
npm install --save-dev bash-task-runner

## To install globally
npm install -g bash-task-runner
```

Alternatively, you can simply download the [src/runner.sh] file
and place it inside your project folder.


## 3. Usage

### 3.1. Setup

Create an empty bash script (`runnerfile.sh`), which is an entry point for the
task runner.

*Optional*: If you want the `runnerfile.sh` to be a self-contained script, add
this to the beginning:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd `dirname ${0}`
source <path_to>/runner.sh
```


### 3.2. Basics

Create some tasks:

```bash
task_foo() {
    ## Do something...
}

task_bar() {
    ## Do something...
}
```

Then you can run tasks with the `runner` tool:

```bash
$ runner foo bar
[23:43:37.754] Starting 'foo'
[23:43:37.755] Finished 'foo' after 1 ms
[23:43:37.756] Starting 'bar'
[23:43:37.757] Finished 'bar' after 1 ms
```

Or in case your script sources the task runner:

```bash
$ bash runnerfile.sh foo bar
```

You can define a default task. It will run if no arguments were provided to the
task runner:

```bash
task_default() {
    ## Do something...
}
```

You can change which task is default:

```bash
runner_default_task="foo"
```

### 3.3. Task chaining

Tasks can launch other tasks in two ways: *sequentially* and in *parallel*.
This way you can optimize the task flow for maximum concurrency.

To run tasks sequentially, use:

```bash
task_default() {
    runner_sequence foo bar
    ## [23:50:33.194] Starting 'foo'
    ## [23:50:33.195] Finished 'foo' after 1 ms
    ## [23:50:33.196] Starting 'bar'
    ## [23:50:33.198] Finished 'bar' after 2 ms
}
```

To run tasks in parallel, use:

```bash
task_default() {
    runner_parallel foo bar
    ## [23:50:33.194] Starting 'foo'
    ## [23:50:33.194] Starting 'bar'
    ## [23:50:33.196] Finished 'foo' after 2 ms
    ## [23:50:33.196] Finished 'bar' after 2 ms
}
```

### 3.4. Error handling

Sometimes you need to stop the whole task if some of the commands fails.
You can achieve this with a simple conditional return:

```bash
task_foo() {
    ...
    php composer.phar install || return
    ...
}
```

If a failed task was a part of a sequence, the whole sequence fails. Same
applies to the tasks running in parallel. Notice that you use this pattern
for the whole sequence too to ensure no further code is executed afterwards
and the overall return code is correctly set:

```bash
task_foo() {
    ...
    runner_sequence foo bar || return
    ...
    echo "Won't show up on error above"
}
```

The difference in `runner_parallel` is if an error occurs in one of the tasks,
other tasks continue to run. After all tasks finish, it returns `0` if
none have failed, `41` if some have failed and `42` if all have failed.

### 3.5. Flags

All flags you pass after the task name are passed to your tasks.

```bash
$ runner foo --production

task_foo() {
    echo ${@} # --production
}
```

To pass options to the `runner` CLI specifically, you must provide them
before any task names:

```bash
$ runner -f scripts/tasks.sh foo
```

To get all possible `runner` CLI options, use the `-h` (help) flag:

```bash
$ runner -h
```

### 3.6. Command echoing

`runner_run` command gives a way to run commands and have them outputted:

```bash
task_default() {
  runner_run composer install
  ## [12:19:17.170] Starting 'default'...
  ## [12:19:17.173] composer install
  ## Loading composer repositories with package information
  ## ...
  ## [12:19:17.932] Finished 'default' after 758 ms
}
```

### 3.7 Bash completion

The `runner` CLI supports autocompletion for task names. Simply add the following line your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
eval $(runner --completion=bash)
```

## 4. Example

This is a real world script that automates the initial setup of a
Laravel project.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd `dirname ${0}`
source runner.sh

NPM_GLOBAL_PACKAGES="gulp bower node-gyp"

task_default() {
    runner_parallel php node || return
    if ! runner_is_defined ${NPM_GLOBAL_PACKAGES}; then
        runner_log_warning "Please install these packages manually:"
        runner_log "'npm install -g ${NPM_GLOBAL_PACKAGES}'"
        exit 1
    fi
}

task_php() {
    runner_sequence php_{composer,vendor} || return
    if [[ ! -e ".env" ]]; then
        cp .env.example .env
        runner_run php artisan key:generate
    fi
}

task_php_composer() {
    if [[ ! -e "composer.phar" ]]; then
        php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
    fi
}

task_php_vendor() {
    runner_run php composer.phar install
}

task_node() {
    runner_parallel node_{npm,bower}
}

task_node_npm() {
    if [[ "${1}" == "--virtualbox" ]]; then
        local npm_options="--no-bin-links"
        runner_log_warning "Using npm options: ${npm_options}"
    fi
    npm install ${npm_options}
}

task_node_bower() {
    bower install
}

runner_bootstrap
runner_log_success "Success!"
```

## 6. Contribution

Please provide pull requests in a separate branch (other than `master`), this
way it's more manageable for me to review and pull.

Before writing code, open an [issue][issues] to get initial feedback and
resolve potential problems. Write all feature related comments there, not into
pull-request.
